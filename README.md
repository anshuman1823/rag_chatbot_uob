RAG Pipeline with Azure OpenAI and FAISS

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Azure OpenAI, FAISS, and LangChain to answer user queries based on relevant documents from a vector database.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline for improved answer quality
âœ… Utilizes Azure OpenAI embeddings and LLM for accurate responses
âœ… Efficient document retrieval using FAISS for fast and scalable vector searches
âœ… Graceful error handling for scenarios where no relevant documents are found
âœ… Transparent logging of context sent to the LLM for improved debugging
